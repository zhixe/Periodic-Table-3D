2. Using Facebook or Linkedin, I want you to login & pull your list of friends or associates
3. In each element in the 3D Object, I want you to replace the chemical element with the first name name of your friend together with his age & his gender (e.g. MARK, 23 M)
4. For each tile, if your friend was male, keep it blue. If it was female, turn it pink
